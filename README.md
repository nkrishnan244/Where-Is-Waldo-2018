# Where-Is-Waldo-2018
"waldo_script.m" is the script used for identifying Waldo. Simply run the script and click two opposite corners of any red and white stripes found in the image to prime the program. Then, click the peak of the fft (the brightest square). 

There are other scripts as well, such as scripts that identify circles in images - "blob_script.m" and "light_blob_script.m". The report on the code can be found in "nkr_HW3".
